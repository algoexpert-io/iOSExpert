Coding Challenge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our company’s backend recently added an endpoint that returns information about cat breeds. This the URL: https://assets.algoexpert.io/course-assets/iosexpert/breeds.json

Create an iOS app that shows a list of cat breeds using this endpoint. Each row in the list shows the breed name, its popularity score, what the breed is known for, and a thumbnail photo of a member of that breed. Users can sort the list by breed name or popularity. 

When the user taps a row, the app displays details about the breed. These details include the name of the breed, a larger photo of a member of the breed, the name of the photographer, a description of the breed, a button to show the photo’s license in Safari, and a button to show the breed’s Wikipedia article in Safari.

Here are the URLs of the licenses of all photos available from the endpoint:

cc1: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/
cc2: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/
cc3: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
cc4: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
ccnd2: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/
pinterest: https://policy.pinterest.com/en/terms-of-service
public_domain: https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/

All possible licenses are represented in JSON from the endpoint. Any other license would be invalid.

When you are finished, zip your Xcode project and email it to your recruiter.

You have one week from receipt of these instructions to complete the coding challenge. We anticipate that the challenge will take you four to six hours.
